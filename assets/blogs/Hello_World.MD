# Hello World!

Hi, this is my personal website.
I'll be posting mostly tech related stuff that I want to share info about!

As for this site it runs on Vite + React and is hosted on Github Pages because I'm broke :).
Blog posts are written in Markdown, because that seems the simlest solution and hey, weren't they meant for this?

Anyways, thanks for reading!
