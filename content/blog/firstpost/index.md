Hi, this is my personal website.

I'll be posting mostly tech related stuff that I want to share info about!

<!--more-->

The old site used React with markdown files, which well wasn't so great for static content hosting. Oopsies.  
This one uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)!  
Which generates and builds the pages, instead of React creating a big, big bundle (and slowing load times)!

This website is then hosted and built onto Github pages.

Repo is here!

Anyways, thanks for reading, back to inactivity for a few months :)!
